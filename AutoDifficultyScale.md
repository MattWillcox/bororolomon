This system allows the program to change the difficulty of the MiniGames depending on how well the player is doing. The higher the player scores, the harder the games become. The system itself tracks the current score of the player. If the player obtains a certain score, the game will increase to the next difficulty. Likewise, if the players lose too many points, the program will decrease the difficulty.
