==Account Management==

A new player can create an account before they can start playing any of the games. The first screen that will be displayed is the log-in menu. A user creates an account by registering a user name and password. Once an account is created, it will have the option to be automatically saved by selecting "remember me" so the player does not have to re-enter his account every time. Only one account at a time can be saved automatically. When other players want to log-in, he/she will be required to enter his/her account. The user will also have the option to skip the log-in and just play the games but no user data will be saved. When a user is logged in their statistics will be recorded, if they are not, their statistics won't be.
