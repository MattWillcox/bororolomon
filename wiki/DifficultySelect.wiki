==Difficulty Selection System==

Once a user has selected a game, they will have the option of setting the difficulty. A higher difficulty will produce more difficult questions and reduce the amount of time allowed to answer them. We will also suggest a "recommended difficulty" that will automatically be determined based on the users data that stored. The three difficulties will be easy, medium and hard.
