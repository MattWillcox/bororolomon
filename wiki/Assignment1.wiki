    </p>
    <p>
        Our game, MathCraft, is intended to help students between grades 1-3 with mathematical ability in a fun and enjoyable way. We are aiming to make
        improving math skills a more interactive experience with the use of visually stimulating objects, catchy music, and addicting math “mini-games” so that
        the student can engage with the information he/she is learning. The game content will follow the <a name="Introduction"></a>British Columbia grades 1-3
        school curriculum so teachers will be able to use it as a tool to aid them with educating. There will be 8 “mini-games” which will offer different ways
        to develop basic math skills. There will be a game for basic math equations, a game for basic money calculation, a game for pattern recognition and a
        game for time/clock understanding. The level of difficulty of the games will increase as the student’s tracked progression advances. Students will also
        be able to view their statistics so they can track their own progress. We will record their high scores and graph their results over time. Our game is
        designed for use on the Apple iPhone and iPod Touch and iPad. We are going to make math everyone’s favorite subject!

        <b>Grade 1-3 Students</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        These will be the primary users of our game. We expect them to have basic experience with video games, preferably of educational video games and
experience with using G.U.I. (Graphical User Interface) components like menus and buttons. The students should have typical 1<sup>st</sup> to 3        <sup>rd</sup> grade knowledge of math (i.e. addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc) depending on their current grade. The goals of each user should
        be to improve their math skills to aid in their education and to have fun while doing it.

    </p>
    <p>
        These will be the primary educators for our students. Our game will aim to aid them in their educating ability. The parents and teachers should have
        basic experience with educational software and G.U.I . components like menus and buttons. They should have full knowledge of all elementary school
        levels of math. The goals of our educators should be to keep the students engaged in learning, track each student’s progress and improve each student’s
        mathematical ability.

        <b>Account Management</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        A new player can create an account before they can start playing any of the games. The first screen that will be displayed is the log-in menu. A user
        creates an account by registering a user name and password. When other players want to log-in, he/she will be required to enter his/her account. The
        user will also have the option to skip the log-in and just play the games, user data will only be temporarily saved. When a user is logged in their
        statistics will be recorded, if they are not, their statistics won't be.

        <b>Menu System</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a user has logged in or skipped the log-in menu they will be taken to the main menu screen. On the main menu the user can select from the
        following options: play games, view progress, options, online leader board. The menu will consist of a simple G.U.I. containing buttons and a
        background. Each selection on the menu can be accessed by the users touch. The user can exit by pressing the button outside of the touch screen. Each
        selection's screen will have the option to go back to the menu.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Score Tracking System and Statistics</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        This can be found in the view progress section. For every game that is finished, each player’s game results will be saved for future reference. Each
        game will have its own section and will include statistics: best score, average score, number of games played. Score will be based on user accuracy and
        speed during game play, faster and more accurate will result in a higher score.

            Difficulty System
            <br/>
        </b>
        Once a user has selected a game and begun playing, as their score increases the level of difficulty of the questions will increase. There will be
        certain milestones that, once reached, will trigger the more difficult questions.

            Online Leader Board
            <br/>
        </b>
        The users will be able to access an online leader board. The leader board will be on a separate website that will open for the user and will list the
        top users based on their top scores for each mini-game. There will be a main page which will contain a leader board of overall scores based on all 8
        games together. This will only work if there is an Internet connection available.

        <b>Speed</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Loading time will be kept as short as possible and shouldn’t any more than 2 seconds. Sounds, images and user profiles will be loaded at start. All
        in-game operations should be instant. Users will have 60 seconds of time in games to answer questions but the game menu will have unlimited time for
        the user to make their selection.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Size</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Its size should be a small number of MB, preferably less than 10. This only includes images sounds and user profiles. We want it fewer than 10 because
        we don’t want long installation times or for it to take up too much space on the users iphone/ipod touch. Most iphone apps are currently under 10 MB so
        we should be able to follow suit.<b></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Ease of use</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        A simple G.U.I. and help sections should make it very easy to learn. Training time will consist of reading the game instructions quickly before
        starting each game. Students may need the aid of a teacher/parent for creating/accessing their user profile since it requires typing and spelling
        skills. The menu should be simple and straightforward for someone with basic knowledge of G.U.I.’s and should require minimal to no training time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Reliability</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        There will be a low probability of application failure because we will have done thorough testing on it before release. Any errors that do occur we
        will try to have error messages displayed so that users can avoid/troubleshoot them. Our game will be able to run without Internet access but some
        features that require an online connection, the online leader board and online help menu will be unavailable. The only way to access our game is with
        an iPhone or iPod Touch on which our game has already been downloaded on or if an Internet connection is available it can be downloaded for free from
        iTunes on any iPhone or iPod Touch.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Robustness</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        The time to restart after failure should be less than 5 seconds. In the event of a crash the user’s data will be from the last completed game, they
        will lose any progress in the current game being played. The user will only need to restart the application to resume playing. There should be a very
        low probability of events causing failure and of data corruption do to our thorough testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Portability</b>
        <b> </b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Can only be used on an Apple iPhone or iPod Touch for now and any future devices released by Apple that will support their applications.
