===Project Justification===

In accordance with providing mathematical education for students, we plan to implement several features into the game which would help with the learning of math for younger children. For example, our timed-questionnaire system provides a challenging aspect to the student, so that their accomplishments would feel much more satisfying and interesting. The ability to have a profile and to compare scores online also motivates the child to do more and try harder, thus improving his or her learning abilities. We try to provide direct ownership of the game to the student, so that they will feel that their accomplishments are their own.

===Project Plannings===

*Basic Goals:*
Rather than to force a traditional teaching environment onto the child (which he or she may find rather boring), our game aims to create an interactive experience with mathematics itself. By creating a program that visually simulates real life objects (ie marbles, animals, etc), we hope to allow the student to connect the information that he or she has learned with the world around them. 

  * Teach math to grade 2-3 students
  * Provide feedback of progress to parents and teachers
  * Improve confidence of students
  * To apply math to real world situations

<br>
*Stakeholders*

We believe based on our game, the following groups may benefit from it's success or suffer from it's failure:

  * Developers (Matt, Light, Ray, Beth, Reza, Nick) - Poor grade
  * Investors - Lose money
  * Apple Inc. - Lose prestige
  * Schools - Less education, Lose money
  * Simon Fraser University - Lose prestige
  * The buyers and users - Lose money and time

<br>
*Targeted Users:*

  * Teachers
  * Grade 2-3 students

<br>
*Assumptions made about student users:*

  * Rudimentary math knowledge
  * Attending school
  * Reading ability
  * Getting bored very easily

<br>
*Assumptions made about the teacher users:*

  * Want to track their student’s progress
  * Interested in teaching math
  * Have some knowledge of computers

<br>
*Planned Features:*

  * Include questions with addition, subtraction, and multiplication of visually simulates real life objects 
  * Students will be able to save and upload their score so that they can track their progress over time
  * The question difficulty will change depending on how many questions the student gets correct
  * Two account types available, student and teacher
  * Allow online comparison of scores
  * Limited amount of time for each question eg. Time bomb

*Risk Management:*
<br> 

|| *Risk* || *Level* || *Contingency Plan* ||
|| Don’t know objective-C || High ||Start learning Objective-C early ||
|| Group members getting sick|| Medium || Contact the group and then, get flu shots and sleep ||
|| Olympics || Medium/High || Coordinate with the group ||
|| Promise too many features || Medium || Research before committing ||
|| Bad weather || Low || Start early and plan ahead ||
