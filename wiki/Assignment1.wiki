Many students in grades two to three have difficulty with math homework. Much of the time they are able to do the work but find it uninteresting and do not feel engaged. We plan to create a math game to supplement or replace math homework. Replacing math homework with a game should increase student interest and math knowledge.

In keeping with the educational nature of the game, our team has placed focus on the needs and interests of students in grade two and three. Rather than to force a traditional teaching environment onto the child (which he or she may find rather boring), our game aims to create an interactive experience with mathematics itself. By creating a program that visually simulates real life objects (ie marbles, animals, etc), we hope to allow the student to connect the information that he or she has learned with the world around them. Our timed-questionnaire system provides a challenging aspect to the student, so that their accomplishments would feel much more satisfying and interesting. The ability to have a profile and to compare scores online also motivates the child to do more and try harder, thus improving his or her learning abilities. We try to provide direct ownership of the game to the student, so that they will feel that their accomplishments are their own.
